![Frontpage](assets/images/application_front_page.png)

MultivariatE Time sEries OutlieR (METEOR) is a R and Java implementation of a complete multivariate time series (MTS) outlier detection system covering problems from pre-processing to post-score analysis. It adopts dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) modeling with the conjunction of a sliding window approach to uncover observations suspected of not have been generated by dataâ€™s underlying processes.
