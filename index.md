## System description

DBNOD is an R and Java implementation of a complete multivariate time series (MTS) outlier detection system covering problems from pre-processing to post-score analysis. It adopts dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) modeling with conjunction of a sliding window approach to uncover observations suspected of not have been generated by data’s underlying processes. The system is formed by 4 main phases depicted in the image below. Most outlier detection methods focus solely on univariate series, providing analysts with strenuous solutions. The presented approach is capable of tackling multivariate longitudinal datasets through a widely accessible web application made available with a tutorial.

Datasets containing MTS are pre-processed prior to modeling if necessary. The pre-processing phase studied is performed using a discretization and dimension reduction technique kown as Symbolic  Aggregate  approX-imation (SAX). Discrete MTS datasets are then employed to the tDBN modeling algorithm, which generates a DBN according to the inserted dataset and parameters chosen. The latter are the Markov lag L, the number of parents p from preceding frames each node can possess and a flag deciding the stationarity of the model. Afterwards, the MTS dataset together with the trained model are delivered to a scoring phase. The aforementioned capitalizes on the structure and parameters of the model to analyze each MTS transition using a sliding window algorithm. Entire series are likewise scored. Subsequently, scores are delivered to a score-analysis strategy which the main goal is to create a boundary differentiating abnormal from normal scores. Two possible strategies are discussed in the present work and later compared, being this the Tukey's method and a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). A score-analysis strategy outputs a threshold used for the final binary classification. Original data associated to scores below the threshold are classified as outliers.

### Pre-Processing

Real-world datasets have a tendency to be continuous and of high dimension. Un-discretized variables foment an heavy and over-fitted model which ends up behaving poorly. The same can be said to over-sampled data. Being the trained model a DBN, pre-processing is required.

A representation known as Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX) is enforced on each input time series (TS) prior to the modeling phase if necessary. The procedure is applied to each univariate TS separately. Each series is then combined to form a discrete MTS dataset, each with an alphabet size chosen in the application. The SAX procedure is seen as 3 steps:

1. Normalization: Every TS is normalized to present zero mean and a standard deviation of one, such is achieved by employing Z-normalization. The mean of a TS is subtracted from every data point. The result is then divided by the TS' standard deviation.

2. Dimensionality Reduction: Each TS of length T can be compressed into equivalent sequences of size m < T. Such can be assured by Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (PAA). The latter subdivides a normalized TS into m equally sized windows. The mean of each window of size T/m is computed replacing all its values. The m means of each window serve as the new TS.

3. Symbolic Discretization: Normalized TS typically have Gaussian distributions. Hence, their domain can be divided into a set of equiprobable regions according to a Gaussian distribution N(0,1). Each region depicts a symbol from the alphabet size chosen. Regions are identified by boundaries, known as breakpoints. The goal is to resolve in which of the regions each TS point resides. A value falling in a certain region is transformed into the symbol associated to that region.

Note that PAA can be overlooked, being normalized TS directly discretized without performing dimensionality reduction.

#### EXAMPLE

Consider a TS comprised by 8 points. After normalizing the series, a PAA transformation of length 3 is employed, creating 3 windows of equal length. 3-point PAA transform can be seen in the image below. The latter is converted to the string "acb" considering an alphabet size of 3, being each symbol region visable in purple in the image. The procedure employs the R package JMotif REF THIS.

generalize to MTS

The pre-processing procedure must be applied to every variable preferably with the same choice of parameters when handling MTS. The selection of such values can have a considerable impact on the course to come. While the PAA parameter determines the level of proximity and memory spent for describing a TS, the alphabet size represents the granularity of expressing each element. With this in mind, it can be shown that for most applications an alphabet size in the range of 5 to 8 normally outputs good results
