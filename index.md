## System description

DBNOD is an R and Java implementation of a complete multivariate time series (MTS) outlier detection system covering problems from pre-processing to post-score analysis. It adopts dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) modeling with conjunction of a sliding window approach to uncover observations suspected of not have been generated by data’s underlying processes. The system is formed by 4 main phases depicted in the image below. Most outlier detection methods focus solely on univariate series, providing analysts with strenuous solutions. The presented approach is capable of tackling multivariate longitudinal datasets through a widely accessible web application made available with a tutorial.

Datasets containing MTS are pre-processed prior to modeling if necessary. The pre-processing phase studied is performed using a discretization and dimension reduction technique kown as Symbolic  Aggregate  approX-imation (SAX). Discrete MTS datasets are then employed to the tDBN modeling algorithm, which generates a DBN according to the inserted dataset and parameters chosen. The latter are the Markov lag L, the number of parents p from preceding frames each node can possess and a flag deciding the stationarity of the model. Afterwards, the MTS dataset together with the trained model are delivered to a scoring phase. The aforementioned capitalizes on the structure and parameters of the model to analyze each MTS transition using a sliding window algorithm. Entire series are likewise scored. Subsequently, scores are delivered to a score-analysis strategy which the main goal is to create a boundary differentiating abnormal from normal scores. Two possible strategies are discussed in the present work and later compared, being this the Tukey's method and a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). A score-analysis strategy outputs a threshold used for the final binary classification. Original data associated to scores below the threshold are classified as outliers.

### Pre-Processing

Real-world datasets have a tendency to be continuous and of high dimension. Un-discretized variables foment an heavy and over-fitted model which ends up behaving poorly. The same can be said to over-sampled data. Being the trained model a DBN, pre-processing is required.

A representation known as Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX) is enforced on each input TS prior to the modeling phase if necessary. The procedure is applied to each univariate TS separately. Each series is then combined to form a discrete MTS dataset, each with an alphabet size chosen in the application. The SAX procedure is seen as 3 steps:

1. Normalization:

2. Dimensionality Reduction:

3. Symbolic Discretization:

Note that PAA can be overlooked, being normalized TS directly discretized.
